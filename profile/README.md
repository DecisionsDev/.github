## IBM Decisions Dev

Welcome to IBM Decisions Dev!. This organization has been created to share open source code & data contributions for IBM Decision Automation capabilities named ODM & ADS.
- IBM ODM stands for Operational Decision Manager, and goes in the continuity of ILOG JRules,
- ADS stands for Automation Decision Services, to bring a top down decision modeling and a native Devops integration through Git and Maven.
Both capabilities can be used through the IBM Cloud Pak for Busines Automation.
