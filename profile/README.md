## IBM Decisions Dev

Welcome! This organization has been created to share open source code & data contributions for IBM Decision Automation capabilities named IBM ODM & ADS:
- IBM ODM stands for Operational Decision Manager, and goes in the continuity of ILOG JRules,
- IBM ADS stands for Automation Decision Services, to bring a top down decision modeling and a native Devops integration through Git and Maven.
